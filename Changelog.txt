Changelog for all additions to the project :

02/12/24 :
- Added sprite animation : DON'T FORGET ANY VALUE FOR THE STRUCT PLAYER'S INITIALIZATION
- Placeholder blue BG

01/12/24 :
- Created new, custom sprites : YOU NEED TO DOWNLOAD THEM MANUALY IF THEY DON'T LOAD

- Corrected player position and jump according to new sprites

20/11/24 :
- Jumping
- Player States

16/11/24 :
- Generated the compile_commands.json with bear tool for clang to recognize all included libraries (local to my computer since paths are too)
- FIXED SEPARATE COMPILATION (just had to rerun ./premake5 gmake2 in the build/, which automatically generates DinoGame.make)
- Added to the player :
    - a velocityY variable
    - an UpdatePlayerPhysics() function to handle gravity
    - a placeholder GROUND_Y value

11/11/24 :
- Added -I../include -Iinclude -I/include as extra file paths for headers in DinoGame.make to try and fix the 'resource_dir.h' file not found (didn't work)

- Added instructions to the README.md 
    - on building/running the executable
    - on using Raylib's Makefile and how to modify it (almost there)

- Removed Makefile(s) from the .gitignore : they're now public on Github 
(Pro-tip : Ignored/untracked files are grey in VSCode's explorer)
