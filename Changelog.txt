Changelog for all additions to the project :

11/11/24 :
- Added -I../include -Iinclude -I/include as extra file paths for headers in DinoGame.make to try and fix the 'resource_dir.h' file not found (didn't work)

- Added instructions to the README.md 
    - on building/running the executable
    - on using Raylib's Makefile and how to modify it (almost there)

- Removed Makefile(s) from the .gitignore : they're now public on Github 
(Pro-tip : Ignored/untracked files are grey in VSCode's explorer)
