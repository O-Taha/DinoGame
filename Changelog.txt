Changelog for all additions to the project :

11/11/24 :
- Added instructions to the README.md 
    - on building/running the executable
    - on using Raylib's Makefile and how to modify it (almost there)

- Removed Makefile(s) from the .gitignore : they're now public on Github 
(Pro-tip : Ignored/untracked files are grey in VSCode's explorer)
